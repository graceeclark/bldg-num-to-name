This program assists in completion of OFM dispatch daily report by deleting unnecessary information and by converting building codes to their names.  
It only works on job slip .csv files exported by AIM. This dictionary is specifically Temple University's main campus facilities' building codes.  
I just made this to see if I can expedite the process because previously we had to do this manually.
